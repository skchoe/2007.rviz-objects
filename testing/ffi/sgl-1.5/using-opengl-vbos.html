<h2>Introduction and motivation</h2>

<p>
Realtime graphics relies on the CPU and the GPU working together.  Each of these components has a separate
memory area attached to it and these areas are joined by a relatively small bus.
The GPU requires all data it works on to be in the attached Video RAM (VRAM) and all data
must at some point be moved across the bus, from CPU accessible RAM into the VRAM.  Compared to the
speed of either VRAM or main system RAM, this bus is painfully slow and so
we'd like a way to minimize the amount of data we force along this bottleneck and also when.
</p>
<p>
We'll look at how OpenGL provides a way to do this for vertex data.  The mechanism is called Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs).
Each VBO encapsulates a chunk of VRAM, and can contain vertex data (like positions,
normals, colours), or index data.
</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>
There are 3 main functions which you will require:
</p>

<pre>glGenBuffers
glBindBuffer
glBufferData
</pre>

<p>
The first step is quite natural and involves generating ids for buffer objects.  This works exactly
the same as generating texture objects:
</p>

<pre>GLuint vbo_id;

glGenBuffers(1,&amp;vbo_id);
</pre>

<p>
In order to use a VBO, you must first bind it.  There are two targets to bind to, the
first is for actual vertex data called GL_ARRAY_BUFFER and the second is for
indexes when drawing indexed primitives (GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER).  Say we wished
to use the VBO we generated for storing vertex data:
</p>

<pre>glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,vbo_id);
</pre>

<p>
We use glBufferData to send our data through the GL to store to the VRAM:
</p>

<pre>glBufferData( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, size_of_data, data, GL_STATIC_DRAW );
</pre>

<p>
The first parameter is a target, the second is the length of the data in bytes.  Next comes the
actual data, finally a set of flags describing how the buffer will be used.
</p>

<p>
The actual data is stored in whatever format required. However, GL needs certain data organised
in certain ways.  For example, a basic vertex structure might contain position, normal and a texture
coordinate.  One way to organise this is in a struct like so:
</p>

<pre>struct Vertex
{
  float pos[3];
  float normal[3];
  float tex0[2];

};
</pre>

<p>
A buffer of such vertices would be allocated and uploaded thus:
</p>

<pre>  int num_verts = 4;
  Vertex* vb = new Vertex[num_verts];

  // fill vb with something interesting

  glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,vbo_id);

  glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, num_verts * sizeof(Vertex), vb, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
</pre>


<p>
To actually use the VBO to perform drawing we use an existing OpenGL mechanism, that
of vertex arrays.  The VBO changes the notion of vertex array from a client side (i.e. in application
memory) to server side (graphics memory) and avoids the transfer of data across the CPU-GPU bus on
each draw call.
</p>

<p>
Drawing the above (we'll presume the 4 vertices are organised as a 2 triangle strip):
</p>

<pre>
  glEnableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY);
  glEnableClientState(GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY);
  glEnableClientState(GL_NORMAL_ARRAY);

  glBindBuffer( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo_id );

  glVertexPointer( 3, GL_FLOAT, sizeof(Vertex), NULL );
  glNormalPointer( GL_FLOAT, sizeof(Vertex), (void*)12 );
  glTexCoordPointer( 2, GL_FLOAT, sizeof(Vertex), (void*)(12+12) );

  glDrawArrays( GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, 0, 4 );

  glDisableClientState( GL_VERTEX_ARRAY );
  glDisableClientState( GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY );
  glDisableClientState( GL_NORMAL_ARRAY );
</pre>

<p>
The first steps are to enable the various arrays (this doesn't need to be done for each draw command,
you just need to have enabled the buffers before using them).  Next we specify the array
pointers.  Unlike vertex arrays, we don't pass actual pointers to the data, but instead pass in
offsets to the vertex buffer.  In this case, the position (VertexPointer) is the first
part of the vertex structure and so has offset 0. The normal comes next at offset 12 (3*sizeof(float)), and finally the
texture coordinate at position 24.
</p>

<p>
To enable indexed primitive drawing (the recommended route for complex meshes), you'll need to
create an index buffer.   This is done in much the same way as a vertex data buffer:
</p>
<pre>
  GLuint ivbo_id;

  glGenBuffers(1,&amp;ivbo_id);

  int num_indices = 6;
  unsigned int* ib = new unsigned int[num_indices];

  // fill index buffer with something interesting, here we'll use the indexes
  // to transform the above 3 vertices from a strip to triangles-in-strip-order
  vb[0] = 0;
  vb[1] = 1;
  vb[2] = 2;
  vb[3] = 1;
  vb[4] = 2;
  vb[5] = 3;

  glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER,ivbo_id);

  glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, num_indices * sizeof(unsigned int), ib, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
</pre>

<p>
Drawing operates in a similar manner to above, we just use glDrawElements instead:
</p>
<pre>
  glEnableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY);
  glEnableClientState(GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY);
  glEnableClientState(GL_NORMAL_ARRAY);

  glBindBuffer( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo_id );
  glBindBuffer( GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ivbo_id );

  glVertexPointer( 3, GL_FLOAT, sizeof(Vertex), NULL );
  glNormalPointer( GL_FLOAT, sizeof(Vertex), (void*)12 );
  glTexCoordPointer( 2, GL_FLOAT, sizeof(Vertex), (void*)(12+12) );

  glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, num_indices, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, (void*)0);

  glDisableClientState( GL_VERTEX_ARRAY );
  glDisableClientState( GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY );
  glDisableClientState( GL_NORMAL_ARRAY );
</pre>

<p>
Note that when using VBOs we pass a null (0) pointer to glDrawElements where we would ordinarily pass
a pointer to the index buffer.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to consider the impact using VBOs has on the card, performance and the
structure of 3D software.
</p>

<h2>Managing multiple buffers</h2>

<p>
Although the basic method is fine for simple single-mesh models or models without different
shaders in use, we will often want to use models with far more complex requirements.
</p>

<p>
Lets say for instance that our mesh has two sections, one which uses a texture object
called 'tex0_id' and the other that uses 'tex1_id'.  We'll obviously need to submit
the geometry in two parts, with the desired textures bound, something like:
</p>

<pre>  glEnableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY);
  glEnableClientState(GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY);
  glEnableClientState(GL_NORMAL_ARRAY);

  // geometry for tex0:

  glBindTexture( GL_TEXTURE_2D, tex0_id);

  glBindBuffer( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo0_id );
  glBindBuffer( GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ivbo0_id );

  glVertexPointer( 3, GL_FLOAT, sizeof(Vertex), NULL );
  glNormalPointer( GL_FLOAT, sizeof(Vertex), (void*)12 );
  glTexCoordPointer( 2, GL_FLOAT, sizeof(Vertex), (void*)(12+12) );

  glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, num_indices0, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, 0);

  // geometry for tex1:

  glBindTexture( GL_TEXTURE_2D, tex1_id);

  glBindBuffer( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo1_id );
  glBindBuffer( GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, ivbo1_id );

  glVertexPointer( 3, GL_FLOAT, sizeof(Vertex), NULL );
  glNormalPointer( GL_FLOAT, sizeof(Vertex), (void*)12 );
  glTexCoordPointer( 2, GL_FLOAT, sizeof(Vertex), (void*)(12+12) );

  glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, num_indices1, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, 0);

  glDisableClientState( GL_VERTEX_ARRAY );
  glDisableClientState( GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY );
  glDisableClientState( GL_NORMAL_ARRAY );
</pre>


<p>
An alternative would be to pack the vertices into a single VBO, and either change
the indexes to reflect this, or update the vertex pointers to refer to the correct start vertex (via an offset in gl*Pointer).
</p>
<p>
A powerful and general way to handle these issues is to use a geometry cache where we store a certain number
of buffers in VRAM at all times, and swap data in and out of the cache as required. 
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
We've seen how vertex buffer objects provide a powerful interface to managing buffers in
VRAM.  Although no direct performance comparisons have been done in this article (available
elsewhere), it is generally recognized knowledge that VBOs outperform any other method
at handling large amounts of geometry.  They also provide a unified way of looking at
geometry and the means of submitting it for drawing.

for using the VBOs is in the Display::render() method.
